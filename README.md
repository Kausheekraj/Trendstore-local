#### 🛍️ Trendstore – CI/CD Deployment on AWS EKS

### 📌 Overview

Trendstore is a frontend-only web application served using Nginx, containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS EKS, and fully automated using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

This project demonstrates a realistic, end-to-end DevOps workflow:

🐳 Containerizing a frontend application

🏗️ Provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform

☸️ Deploying and scaling workloads on Kubernetes (EKS)

🔁 Automating build & deployment with Jenkins

📊 Monitoring cluster and workloads using Prometheus & Grafana

🔐 Secure GitHub → Jenkins integration using Cloudflared

High-level flow:

GitHub push → Jenkins pipeline → Docker build & push → EKS deploy → HPA scaling → Monitoring dashboards

├─ k8s/ # Deployment, Service, HPA
├─ scripts/ # Build, deploy, cleanup logic

```

This separation mirrors real-world production projects:

- Application artifacts
- Infrastructure as Code
- Operational automation

---

### 🧱 Architecture Summary

## 🔁 CI / Source Control

GitHub hosts:

- Application code
- Infrastructure (Terraform)
- Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile)

Jenkins pipeline is triggered via GitHub Webhooks.

Cloudflared securely exposes a local/private Jenkins instance without opening inbound ports.

---

## 🐳 Containerization & Registry

Application is a static frontend served by Nginx.

Docker image is built from application/dist.

Docker Compose ensures:

- Local testing
- CI consistency

Image is pushed to Docker Hub:  kausheekraj/trendstore-nginx

---

🏗️ Infrastructure (Terraform on AWS)

Provisioned entirely using Terraform:

- Custom VPC with public & private subnets
- Internet Gateway + NAT Gateway
- IAM roles for:
  - EKS control plane
  - Worker nodes
- AWS EKS cluster (trendstore-eks)
- Managed node group (cost-efficient instance types)

✅ Terraform ensures the infrastructure is reproducible, version-controlled, and auditable.

### ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

## 📦 Deployment

Runs an Nginx container serving static frontend assets.

Resource requests & limits are defined to enable autoscaling:

| Resource | Request | Limit |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU | 100m | 250m |
| Memory | 128Mi | 256Mi |

## 🌐 Service (Updated Design)

The application is exposed using a LoadBalancer service.

Why LoadBalancer instead of NodePort?

- Automatically provisions an AWS Elastic Load Balancer
- Provides a public DNS endpoint
- No manual node IP or port handling
- More realistic for production-style EKS deployments
- Simplifies access during demo and submission

📈 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

- Scales pods from 1 → 5 replicas
- Triggered at 60% CPU utilization
- Verified using k6 load testing

### 🤖 Why Jenkins?

- Clear, stage-based declarative pipelines
- Strong Docker & Kubernetes integration
- Widely used in real-world production environments

### 🧪 Pipeline Stages (Summary)

- Checkout: Pull source code from GitHub
- Prepare Scripts: Ensure operational scripts are executable
- Build Image: Build Docker image using Docker Compose
- Push Image: Authenticate to Docker Hub; push latest and versioned images
- Configure Kubeconfig: Inject AWS credentials; run aws eks update-kubeconfig
- Deploy to EKS: Apply Deployment, Service, and HPA manifests
- Monitoring Setup: Install / upgrade kube-prometheus-stack via Helm
- Health Checks: Validate nodes, pods, and HPA behavior
- Grafana Verification: Confirm dashboards and metrics visibility

---

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

## 🔍 Stack (Installed via Helm)

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- kube-state-metrics
- node-exporter
- Alertmanager

# 💡 Why kube-prometheus-stack?

Industry-standard Kubernetes monitoring bundle; minimal manual configuration and preconfigured dashboards make it ideal for production-like observability demos.

# 🔐 Access Method

Prometheus & Grafana accessed via kubectl port-forward to avoid public exposure of monitoring endpoints — a common and secure operational practice.

🎯 Key Design Decisions (Why This Matters)

- Nginx + static assets → lightweight, fast, production-standard
- Docker everywhere → consistency across local, CI, and Kubernetes
- Terraform for EKS → reproducible infrastructure
- HPA-enabled workloads → cloud-native scaling
- Jenkins pipelines → full CI/CD visibility
- Helm for monitoring → avoids YAML sprawl
- Cloudflared → secure webhooks without opening ports

---

### ✅ Outcome

This project delivers a complete DevOps lifecycle: automated builds and deployments, Kubernetes-based autoscaling, production-style monitoring, and secure CI/CD integration. The focus is on clarity, realism, and operational correctness over unnecessary complexity.
